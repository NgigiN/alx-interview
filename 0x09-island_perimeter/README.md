Alx-interview question for island perimeter.

Goal: Calculate the perimeter of a sigle island grind, where the grid is represented by a 2d arrays of integers. 1 represents land and 0 represents water. Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells). The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

Concepts Needed: 2D arrays, conditional logic, counting techniques, Python programming.

Instructions:
Create a function def island_perimeter(grid): that returns the perimeter of the island described in grid:

    grid is a list of list of integers:
        0 represents water
        1 represents land
        Each cell is square, with a side length of 1
        Cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
        grid is rectangular, with its width and height not exceeding 100
    The grid is completely surrounded by water
    There is only one island (or nothing).
    The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to the water surrounding the island).
